# Tutorials
This section of this github project is made for tutorials. You will find tutorials related to our mobile offerings and server-side solutions. The tutorials are created by our developers for developers.

# What to expect
You may find tutorials helpful or not, they may work smooth in your environment or maybe not. In any case we encourage you to contribute via pull requests to enhance or correct an existing tutorial or to add your own.

# Feedback
We are certainly happy about any feedback on these tutorials, especially if they helped you in your daily work life!

# IMPORTANT
If any tutorial has an issue please do not contact CA support. We do not run these tutorials through QA since our main goal is to get them to you rather easy and fast than via an official process that includes QA and documentation. Please communicate via comments, pull requests and emails to the author of the tutorial if you have any issues or questions.

Enjoy!
