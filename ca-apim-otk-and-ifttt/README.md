# CA APIM OAuth Toolkit and IFTTT

## Disclaimer

This is a tutorial, not a production ready software. The purpose is to give an idea to developers how CA API Gateway 
with OTK and IFTTT can be leveraged to support additional use cases. There is no warranty that it works in all 
environments. As I would say in Germany: "Es ist, wie es ist!" - "It is, as it is!".

However, I have tried to enable interested users to get going fast and easy.

**IMPORTANT:** 

This tutorial comes with preconfigured client_id and client_secret and a fake username and password. Please
 note that these are included to give you an idea how the system should like like once it is configured. Before you 
 start implementing any apps use your own client_id and client_secret and user names! The instructions further down will 
 explain what you need to do! 

Nevertheless, enjoy!
